Overview
This project consists of:

Frontend: A React application located in the frontend directory, served on port 3000.
Backend: A Node.js application located in the backend directory, served on port 5000.
Docker: Both services are containerized and managed using Docker Compose for easy development and deployment.

Prerequisites

Docker installed on your machine.
Docker Compose installed.
Node.js (optional, for local development outside Docker).

Setup

Clone the Repository:
git clone <repository-url>
cd <repository-name>


Ensure Required Files:

Verify that frontend/src/index.js exists. If you renamed App.js to index.js, ensure it contains the correct React entry point:import React from 'react';
import ReactDOM from 'react-dom/client';
import App from './App';
import './App.css';

const root = ReactDOM.createRoot(document.getElementById('root'));
root.render(
  <React.StrictMode>
    <App />
  </React.StrictMode>
);




Check Dockerfiles:

Ensure frontend/Dockerfile and backend/Dockerfile are correctly configured to copy files and run npm install and npm run build (for frontend) or npm start (for backend).



Running the Project

Build and Start Containers:Run the following command from the project root (where docker-compose.yml is located):
docker-compose up --build

This builds the Docker images for the frontend and backend and starts the containers.

Access the Application:

Frontend: Open http://localhost:3000 in your browser to view the React app.
Backend: Access the API at http://localhost:5000 (adjust based on your backend's routes).


Stop the Containers:To stop the running containers:
docker-compose down



Troubleshooting

Missing index.js Error:If you encounter an error like Could not find a required file. Name: index.js, ensure frontend/src/index.js exists. If you have App.js instead, rename it:
cd frontend/src
mv App.js index.js

Then rebuild: docker-compose build frontend.

Port Conflicts:If ports 3000 or 5000 are in use, update the ports section in docker-compose.yml or free the ports.

Build Failures:Clear the Docker build cache and retry:
docker-compose build --no-cache
